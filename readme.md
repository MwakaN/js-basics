Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category - Dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime, while statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time. This means that scripts written in dynamically-typed languages can compile even if they contain errors that will prevent the script from running properly (if at all). While if a script written in a statically-typed language contains errors, it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed.
Examples of dynamically typed languages - Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript
Examples of statically typed languages - Java, C, C++, C#, Scala
